## Polyglot Advantage

I.T's all about choosing the right tool for the right job.

When it comes to crafting Windows Applications, there is no doubt that C# is my |favorite| programming language.

Penned in Visual Studio, "Doctor Quote for C#" demonstrates how to create a real-world WinForms GUI using Modern SQLite 3. 

The project also demonstrates how to manage namespaces between stand-alone data-access Assemblies for shared re-use between languages such as Visual Basic (etc,) as well.
